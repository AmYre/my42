# SoLong

This project is about coding a little game in order to handle graphics in C (miniLibX).

## How was it?

Finally a very motivating project. Making your own game is very symbolic, if like me you are used to be the player 
instead of the artist behind the code. Yeah solo game developers are plain artists.
Getting started was a bit of a pain, as usual onboarding config are always trouble. So after going through
the MLX documentation you unlock new superpowers : opening a window, putting images, texts, listening to events.

At this point it just pure enjoyment. Using your new abilities to come out with your own solutions so that
you respect the game rules.

Polishing (handling all cases of possible leaks) was hard but worth it.
