## How was it?

Finally ! I waited so long to dive in with the big blue whale, i am so glad I did! <br/>
The inception project itself focus a lot on bash scripting you way through. But the real take is the pretext to learn about containerization. <br/><br/>
If you came from a context where Wordpress and MySQL databases are new to you, the project can be a little overwhelming.<br/>
Because you will have to digest that, AND all about docker not knowing by experience who do what. <br/>
The fact that 42 impose doing it in a VM is quite a curious move. I mean docker is already a layer of virtualization. Doing it in VM will tend to make it more difficult to grasp for beginners. <br/><br/>
I guess that is why the project is called inception...<br/>

I recommend decomposing everything bit by bit.<br/><br/><br/>
