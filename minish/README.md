## How was it?

Minishell is a milestone in the 42 cursus common core. It is known to be the moment where you can fail your run against the blackhole and
having your dreams ended. In the other hand, surviving minishel supposed to be rewarding. A lot of my sempais shared experience are about reincarnation.
About how they changed after minishell. Before and After effect.

I have to be honest here. It was very disapointing.
Compared to previous projects, there is no take aways. No new learnings. Only doing what you already know
but with an infinite way to fail...

So you pass an equivalent amount of time, comparing what bash does and mimicking brainlessly the same behaviour. Even if it make no sense sometimes.
If you dare not to. You open a possibily to be failed at your evaluation.

Okay okay i will try my best to be more positive...
You learn a lot about bash commands and the guts of how a shell works. Parser, Lexer, Tokenisation, Abstract Syntax trees.
If its the kind of knowlegde you are looking for, you will be in a maxiheaven, other wise welcome to MiNiHeLL ! ðŸ˜…


## The Ressources used and tips

Every bash documentation out there.
Tests by friends who survived hell will make you win a lot of time.
Be patient. 
Do not be fooled by trting to reproduce Bash per say, be smart and stick to the subject.
