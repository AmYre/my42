# NetPractice

This project is about connecting people (i.e. Network and Subnetting). Sponsored by Nokia_3310

## How was it?

I always feared network infra, sysadmin stuff. It feels like it is to low level for me, unreachable.<br/>
But this project proved once again, that Knowledge is Fear's greatest enemy. I loved this project !<br/>
It was very didactic. I was playing found the subnet game all along üòÅ.<br/>
Plus, it was a good pretext to see all about OSI layer model, the different protocols, and globally how internet magic works behind the scene.<br/>
<br/>
The evaluation in the other hand can be quite stressfull. You only have 15 minutes to achieve live 3 subnetting exercices.<br/>
So master this one skill and you will be fine :<br/>
IP address : 124.145.110.28<br/>
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.128<br/>

1 - You go from the subnet mask number of interest (not 255, not 0), in our case => 128<br/>
2 - From it you go to 256. So 128 to go to 256 there is 128 to add. You have your magic number.<br/>
3 - Ask yourself in what range of 128 the number of interest of the ip address (parallel to the mask => 28) can be on ?<br/>
=> 28 can be contained between 0-128. So you have it.<br/>
Network address   = 124.145.110.0<br/>
Broadcast address = 124.145.110.128<br/>
Usable range addresses = 124.145.110.1 --- 124.145.110.127<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
## Another example to do Subnetting with the Magic Number<br/>
<br/>
You open your subnetting exercice and it gives you this :<br/>
IP address : 153.63.181.254<br/>
Subnet mask: 255.255.192.0<br/>
<br/>
1 - You go from the subnet mask number of interest (not 255, not 0), in our case => 192<br/>
2 - From it you go to 256. So 192 to go to 256 there is 64 to add. You have your magic number => 64.<br/>
3 - Ask yourself in what range of 64 the number of interest of the ip address (parallel to the mask => 181) can be on ?<br/>
The ranges of 64 you have to imagine in your mind : 0-64-128-192-256<br/>
=> 181 can be contained between 128-192. So you have it.<br/>
Network address   = 153.63.128.0<br/>
Broadcast address = 153.63.192.0<br/>
Usable range addresses = 124.145.128.1 --- 124.145.191.255<br/>
<br/>
With this technique the apparent mystical shenanigans of Netpractice becomes crystal clear. You see everything.<br/>

## The Ressources used<br/>
<br/>
To grasp all the kmowledge around Subnetting, like Binary conversion, CIDR table etc.. i found an amazing playlist<br/>
that talks about network with refreshing pov. The ressources in this filed are so dusty. People so not fun... This playlist is quite unique :<br/>

I learned the magic recipe in here :<br/>
