## How was it?

I do not have much to say on this project because my mate did all the heavy lifting. She handled all the mathematical/raycasting part.<br/>
But before meeting her i did try to document myself on the matter. And was very surprised to see so scarse ressources for this project.<br/>
LODEV !<br/>
A tutorial who only explains raycasting (in C++). Who ever i asked around me for guidance has pointed me that guide.<br/>
Very strange to see so many generations of 42 studs only relying on one unique ressource.<br/>
The problem was that this tutorial explains well raycasting, but not in the context of cub3D.<br/>
And to be fair here, i am not looking for a free win backseat guide.<br/>
Never been interested, i am here to learn.<br/>
But a starting point ? Yes please. Raycasting, raycasting, raycasting, okay but where to start ?<br/>
I usually find my own way to progress quite easily. But on this one I didn't.<br/>
This is our second graphical project. For so_long for example, i found my way to start.<br/>
	- I initialised the MLX first
	- added assets
	- then parsed my map
	- make correspond the assets with the map
	- listening to the keyboard
	- move accordingly
See what i did here ? Very natural way to progress in the project. So when i was asking around, that was the kind of feedback i was expecting.<br/>
But the only answer i had were : "did you read LODEV raycasting ?".<br/>
Now i know why they were not able to give me one. Because its the kind of ceil progression project, 0 or 1, not a linear curve.<br/>
There is no progressive way to do the project. No way to split methodologically the project. This is why i stayed stuck so long before even start.<br/>
You want to display something in your window ? You need the raycasting upfront !<br/>
I am not very kean to code 3 weeks without seeing my progression... Learned my lesson on this one<br/>

## The Ressources used
<br/>
Sick of LODEV's, 20 years old, not friendly, not cub3d contextualised, One-sided tutorial ?<br/>
Our friends at 1337 Marocco did a fantastic work to properly document the project, unfortunately not enough referenced by Google :
