# Born2BeRoot

This project is about creating a virtual machine and learning how to administrate it.

## Bonuses?

There is two bonuses in this project. Ils sont tres inegaux. The first one is about more advanced partioning. It changes nothing. You learn nothing more. Just take you longer to configure...

But the second one is the complete opposite. It is installing a Wordpress. It makes so much sense to have it installed that, in my opinion, it should not be optional.
It gives a real purpose to the VM. Why administrate a whole machine if it has no use right ?

## What take away ?

So much to learn here. When i started the cursus, i heard all about b2broot way before i had my grasp on it. "Its boring". "Its just config". Definitely the least loved project of the first circle.

I understand the critiques. You are away of your favorite code editor. No C coding. But in the end you learn a lot here.

You really use bash commands a lot. In a real context. Not just for validating last exo piscine. Real use make better learning. Switching users, allowing ports, using ssh and so on.

For me the best take away is having wordpress, php, mysql working together in your own VM. Free from charges üòÅ.

Creating the ftp connection from my local machine to the VM to manage the file uploads was a real WOW moment for me.

## The Ressources used

# For the installation part

-   [Hanshazairi Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w-2MX5QrQw)

# For the rest / the bonuses / the training eval

-   [Gemartin Github](https://github.com/gemartin99/Born2beroot-Tutorial/blob/main/README_EN.md) - Big shoutout to this guy. He understood the way a good guide is done. Not just the brainless lists of commands, but a lot of verbose explanations about context and why and how the commands are here for.
