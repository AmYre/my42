## How was it?

It had the chance to be part of the new formula, giving me the opportunity to tackle the project by choosing from a lot of modules.<br/>
It goes from Cybersec to Accessibilty with everything in between. Being a team project that is a great idea to offer so much flexibility !<br/><br/>
But as often with 42 subjects, some choices feel so arbitrary sometimes. Like you are forced to do vanilla JS for the the front, wich is a great idea to learn basics.<br/>
But for backend you can only go for Django or Ruby. What the heck ? I mean i am not guarding my chapel, but if the point is to learn JS, NodeJS or its frameworks felt like very appropriate... <br/>
Anyway it was a good opportunity to learn Django and write my first python lines of code ðŸ¤—. I loved my dev experience with Django, so handy. It has everything you need and more.<br/><br/>
But like in other projects, the "arbitrary" choices of the subjects hit me again. The app HAS TO BE an SPA. Why ? You just left us choose for a nice backend that handles templating and routing so smoothly, why forcing me to inject the HTML client side then ?<br/>
I personally have a background in web development and had no problem with the concept of SPA and SSR. But boy I can tell you that made miserable the life of my mates and other studs on the same projects. <br/>
