This represents, time, tears and blood. But feel free to use it as I used other repos to help me in this enlighting journey. 
In 42, many thinks about reading other repos as cheating. I can not desagree more.
Tools in our cultural society is all about how we use them. The famous example of the knife...
Yeah if you never wrote a line of code and just speedrunning your 42 by copy pasting from github, that is definitevly wrong.
But why being so pessimistic about human behavior, about us. How about having faith in smartness, and bet in good judgment.
For me. Being able to compare code, see other way to think, is a big part of learning. The best one.
Code by yourself, definitely. But do not code alone.

Remember The Collective from Star Trek ?
