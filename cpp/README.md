# C++

This regroups the two "piscines" of CPP modules. From 00 to 04 and from 05 to 09.

## How was it?

A new language to learn! Always galvanizing. I was already familiar with Object Oriented languages, so for me it wasn't that new.<br/>
But it was very interesting reinforcing those notions. And very glad to have this new card on my sleeve.<br/>
<br/>
I do not see myself using C outside of learning purposes, but C++ is a nice plus(+)...ðŸ‘€<br/>
About the language itself I have nothing much to say, very versatile, lots of useful libs, loved the overriding of operators and templates.<br/>
I remember having a good laugh when discovering templates ðŸ¤£.<br/>
I watched the videos of intra 42 to document myself, and as expected, 42 philosophy is so encline to embrace robustness in code. The videos are all about enforcing rules, good practices, const, private, types...<br/>
But when templates are finally approached, they are described as one of the more powerful tools in c++ (they give birth to containers).<br/>
Seems like the power of it resides in removing the types by making everything generic ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£<br/>
I mean...Why bother being so conservative then? Go directly code in JS ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£<br/>
Anyway.<br/>
<br/>
C++ was fine, cool to learn and to have as a skill. But I want to spill the tea on the modules themselves.<br/>
On how 42 didactize, create subjects.<br/>
<br/>
And to be franc. It is close to catastrophic.<br/>
<br/>I love my school. Proud to be a stud. Wearing the merchs. Bragging about it outside.<br/>
But i am not blind. Nor clueless about education...<br/>
The subjects are bad!<br/>
They are bad to make you understand what you have to learn. And even when you do get what is to be focused on, they will be evaluated part who will just appear out of thin air.<br/>
I will not do a list of everything but, to sum up, they are so bad that you will fail them if you play the game.<br/>
The other studs I had the opportunity to chat about this, agree on the fact that you want the evaluation sheet before showing up to the real evaluation to anticipate those last minute appearances.<br/>
That is how bad it is. When bypassing the system becomes the system, you know something went wrong.<br/>
