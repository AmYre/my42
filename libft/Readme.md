# Libft

This project includes bonuses and passes three testers :

 - [Unit Test](https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test)
 - [libftTester](https://github.com/Tripouille/libftTester)
 - [Warmachine](https://github.com/0x050f/libft-war-machine)


## Edito

Libft was a lot like redoing the piscine. Creating the functions we already know and love are not difficult by itself.
The hard part is making them "production ready". For me that was a real pain. 
The moment i tried the testers to challenge my code, the dimension of the project changed.
That is the moment you start learning again. How to make a smart memory allocation ? How can i use an existing function to optimise ?


## What take away ?

- Learning the use of Makefile
- Combining existing functions creatively
- Securing Mallocs
- Chained list if you do the Bonuses
  

## Do the bonuses worth it ?
Doing the bonuses was very fun. The best part of this project. 
I do not hide that creating repetitive functions by interprating an (imo) arbitrary man again and again was not very fulfilling.
The bonuses came as refreshing as it can gets after a looong and boring ft_tunnel.
They give you perspective as a new way to handle Data Structure : Chained List.
