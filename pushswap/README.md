# PushSwap

This project is about creating a sorting algorithm, well... kinda.

## How was it?

Before I even start the project i was already bookmarking everything labelled 'Complexity', 'BigO notation', 'bubble/merge/quick/*/sort'.
The disappointement was my fault. This concept is so representative of computer science imaginary, I thought it was it !
But in the end this is not really a sorting algorithm per say. It is more like a game of optimsation. Only the output are read.
**Not the complexity of it. Not the time spent computing.**
You have three actions on a stack, rotating, swaping and pushing. You will have to use the best combination of those actions
to came out with the less action possible to sort a set of numbers in order.

Thats it. No new skills learned on this one, but making stronger the use of linked list.


## The Ressources used

A lot of students fall on the pit of sorting algorithm because the subject imply it. Not having full score because they stood by Radix, Insert, blabla sort. But it is really not about that. Wth this two ressources
you can clearly understand that is all about defining a target and the cheapest number of action to get to it :
