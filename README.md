This represents blood, sweat and tears. But feel free to use it, just as I used other repos to help me in this enlighting journey. 
At 42, many think of reading other repos as cheating. I couldn't desagree more.
Tools in our cultural society is all about how we use them.

Yeah if you have never wrote a line of code and rushing through your projects by copy/pasting from github, that is definitevly wrong.
But why are we being so pessimistic about human behavior, about us. How about having faith in intelligence and sound judgment.

Being able to compare code, to see another way of thinking, is a big part of learning. The best one.
Code by yourself, definitely. But do not code alone.

Remember The Collective from Star Trek ?
